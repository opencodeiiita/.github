### 🙋‍♀️ Introduction:
A month-long program starting in December for students to start their journey in the world of open source.
The Only requirement being an enthusiastic heart to learn.😻


### 🌈 How Opencode works?
- Claim Issue: It doesn't matter whether you know how to solve it. Don't look out for issues you know how to solve, but rather to the once you don't know how to solve! This will be your opening door to learning something new.

- Solve Issue: After claiming the issue, now it's the time to explore ways on how to proceed. Mentors and Google will be to your rescue here. Take advantage of both to the most.

- Open a Pull Request: After reading everything on internet ever written and those to be written in future, it's the time to open your pr. This will be the golden moment, where you will discover another 100 ways git could make you cry!

- Climb the Leaderboard: After spending another sleepless night to see your pr getting merged it's the time to climb up the leaderboard and enjoy that shortliving "I love Programming" feeling!
